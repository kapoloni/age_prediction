# Torch implementation of a brain age estimation model.

Torch implementation of EfficientNet B0 to estimate the brain age from hippocampal MR images of cognitively normal subjects.
Efficient Model from: https://github.com/shijianjian/EfficientNet-PyTorch-3D <br>
and paper: EfficientNet: Rethinking Model Scaling for Convolutional Neural Networks<br>
